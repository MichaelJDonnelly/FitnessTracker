# FitnessTracker
Calculates the daily number of calories you need to maintain your weight. The fitness tracker gathers basic information about your body such as your weight, height, age and activity level and utilises the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation to provide you with your basal metabolic rate (BMR) and your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).

What is your BMR and TDEE anyway? Put simply, your BMR is the number of calories required by your body to stay at your current weight while sedentary. Yes, the number of calories needed by your body even if you were to sit on the sofa all day! Your TDEE is your total daily energy expenditure. That's the number of calories needed by your body to maintain your current weight (unlike BMR, this takes into account your activity level). This essentially means if you are physically active, you need more calories to maintain your current weight!

What's next for this project?

I hope to add some more features to this soon such as:

*The ability to select a goal eg: gain weight, lose weight, clean bulk, lose fat while gaining muscle

*The ability to select a different equation to calculate calories
